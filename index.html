<p>
I am a Professor at the University of Sydney.
My research is in radio transients, and I co-lead the transient projects (VAST) on 
the Australian SKA Pathfinder.
</p>
<p>
I teach computational science and data science for physics and astronomy
students, and I'm particularly interested in online teaching and teaching
innovation. 
</p>
<p>
You can find me in Room 358 in the School of Physics, but email is the best
way of getting in touch.
