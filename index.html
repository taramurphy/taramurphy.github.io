  <br></br>
  I am a Professor at the University of Sydney and Associate Investigator in the
  <a href="https://www.ozgrav.org">OzGrav Centre of Excellence</a>. My research is in radio transients, and I co-lead
  the transient projects (VAST) on the Australian SKA Pathfinder.
  <br></br>
  I teach computational science and data science for physics and astronomy students,
  and I'm particularly interested in online teaching and teaching innovation.
  <br></br>
  You can find me in Room 358 in the School of Physics, but email is the best way
  of getting in touch.
