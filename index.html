  I am Head of School of Physics at the University of Sydney and a Chief Investigator in the
  <a href="https://www.ozgrav.org">OzGrav Centre of Excellence</a>. My research is in radio transients, and I co-lead
  the <a href="https://vast-survey.org">Variables and Slow Transients (VAST)</a> project on the Australian SKA Pathfinder.
  <br></br>
  I teach computational science and data science for physics and astronomy students,
  and I'm particularly interested in online teaching and teaching innovation.
  <br></br>
  You can find me in Room 214 in the School of Physics, but email is the best way
  of getting in touch.
