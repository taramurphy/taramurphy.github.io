to set up a STEM program for high school students.

In 2017 we launched
the [first ICT and coding courses available in Khmer](https://groklearning.com/ictangkor/),
based on the Australian curriculum. Read more about [preparing young Khmer for life in the digital age](https://blog.groklearning.com/preparing-young-khmer-for-life-in-the-digital-age-6b336d94df4a).


## Coding in schools
Programming and computational thinking are critical skills for today's students.
We're helping improve the programming skills of students and teachers through the [Australian Computing Academy](https://aca.edu.au/)
