## Radio monitoring of gravitational wave events
The detection of gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation from a
neutron star merger was a scientific breakthrough, with important
implications for physics and astronomy. We are using three Australian radio
telescopes to search for and monitor radio waves from future gravitational
wave events. These observations will provide key information to unlock the
mystery of what causes some of the most energetic events in the Universe,
their environment and how they evolve.

Some of our recent papers are:

## ASKAP radio transients
Transients are astronomical objects that appear and disappear or change
rapidly; they are our window to some of the most extreme processes in the
Universe. Transient events can occur when black holes form, causing
supernovae and gamma-ray bursts; when stars collide with black holes; or
when hot, magnetised planets interact with their host stars. There are also
mysterious transients of unknown origin, like fast radio bursts.

The Variables and Slow Transients ([VAST](https://www.vast-survey.org/)) project on the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope will investigate all of these phenomena through a suite of widefield surveys.

Some of our recent papers on gigahertz radio variability are:

## Low frequency radio transients
Magnetised extrasolar planets are expected to emit strongly at low radio
frequencies, in the same way that Jupiter does. So far, most exoplanets have
been detected through indirect means such as radial velocity and transit
searches but radio observations can provide another method of making direct detections.

We are searching for exoplanet emission, and studying other variable sources such as flare stars at low radio frequencies using the Murchison Widefield Array Telescope.
